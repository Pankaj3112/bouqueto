# Bouqueto — Design Document

## Overview

Bouqueto is a public web app for building and sharing digital flower bouquets. Users pick flowers, customize their arrangement with greenery, write a personal card message, then share via a unique link. Inspired by [Digibouquet](https://digibouquet.vercel.app) with a modern UI identity.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Database:** Convex
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **UI Requirement:** Modern, polished — use frontend-design skill during implementation

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page — branding, "Build a Bouquet" CTA |
| `/bouquet` | Multi-step builder (picker → arrangement → card) |
| `/bouquet/[id]` | Shared bouquet view for recipients |
| `/garden` | Public gallery of recent bouquets |

## User Flow

### Step 1: Landing Page (`/`)
- "Bouqueto" logo in decorative script font
- Tagline
- "BUILD A BOUQUET" primary CTA button
- "VIEW GARDEN" link
- Warm cream/beige background, modern minimal aesthetic

### Step 2: Flower Picker (first step on `/bouquet`)
- Responsive grid of ~12 flower images (5 cols desktop, 3 mobile, 2 small)
- Click flower → increments count, shows badge number
- Hover → tooltip with name, meaning, birth month
- Selected flowers appear as pills below grid: `ORCHID x1`, `TULIP x3`
- Click pill → deselects that flower
- Constraint: 6-10 total blooms
- "NEXT" button enables at 6+

### Step 3: Bouquet Customizer (second step on `/bouquet`)
- CSS/DOM-based composition in a responsive container
- Flowers are absolutely-positioned `<img>` elements
- Positions generated by randomized algorithm (center-heavy circular distribution)
- Random rotation (-30 to +30 deg) and scale variation (0.8x-1.2x)
- Greenery images layered behind flowers (lower z-index)
- "TRY A NEW ARRANGEMENT" — re-randomizes positions
- "CHANGE GREENERY" — cycles through greenery sets
- All positions use percentages for responsiveness

### Step 4: Card Writer (third step on `/bouquet`)
- Centered textarea with card-style border
- Flower illustrations flanking both sides
- Serif font for handwritten feel
- Back/Next navigation

### Step 5: Save & Share
- User clicks Save → Convex mutation creates bouquet record → redirect to `/bouquet/[id]`
- Share page shows: header, bouquet composition, card message
- "COPY LINK" button + "SHARE" button (Web Share API on mobile)

### Garden (`/garden`)
- Grid of recent bouquets from Convex (paginated)
- Each shows a thumbnail of the composed bouquet
- Click → navigates to `/bouquet/[id]`

## Data Model

### Flower Config (static, in code)
```ts
interface Flower {
  id: string          // e.g. "orchid"
  name: string        // "Orchid"
  meaning: string     // "Beauty"
  birthMonth: string  // "October"
  image: string       // "/flowers/orchid.png"
}
```

### Convex `bouquets` Table
```ts
{
  flowers: Array<{ flowerId: string, count: number }>
  arrangement: Array<{ x: number, y: number, rotation: number, scale: number, flowerId: string }>
  greeneryStyle: string
  cardMessage: string
  createdAt: number
}
```

## Client State (builder page)
```ts
{
  currentStep: number                    // 1-4, client-only
  selectedFlowers: { flowerId, count }[] // user's picks
  arrangement: { x, y, rotation, scale, flowerId }[]  // generated positions
  greeneryStyle: string                  // active greenery set
  cardMessage: string                    // card text
}
```

## Flower Art Assets

- V1: Using reference assets from Digibouquet (to be replaced)
- Final: Custom illustrations created by user
- Format: PNG with transparent backgrounds
- ~12 flower types + 3-4 greenery sets

## V1 Scope

**In scope:**
- Color mode only
- 12 flowers, 3-4 greenery styles
- Full build → customize → card → share flow
- Shareable links via Convex
- Garden page
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Out of scope (future):**
- Black & white mode
- User accounts / auth
- Bouquet deletion/editing after save
- OG image generation
- Animation/transitions between steps

## Visual Design Direction

- Modern, clean, premium feel
- Warm cream/beige palette with dark text
- Decorative font for logo, monospace uppercase for headings
- Lots of whitespace, centered layouts
- Mobile-first responsive
- Use frontend-design skill for high-quality implementation
